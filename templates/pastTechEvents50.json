Free WiFi networks allow attackers to intercept and alter your communications. This presentation shows a series of live demonstrations showing exactly how this is done and how easy it is.

This is particularly an issue when it comes to application security. Deadlines are looming with no time or resources left for any disruptions, especially not another security bug. Teams will more often than not simply do nothing, while even the most proactive ones will only order a quick vulnerability scan to ensure that there are no obvious security problems.\u00a0Days, months and even years may pass without an incident, until the ugly face of hackers show up and a security incident happens. With exploits making the news headlines daily, it is pretty clear that neither attackers nor security bugs are going anywhere. It is also clear that whatever we are doing today as far as application security (or the lack of) is not working.</p> <p>If the above sounds familiar then you will need to attend this presentation. You will understand what you will need to focus on first, what to do to achieve systematic results out of your application security assessments, open-source tools to use, static code analysis and manual code review techniques and finally the main components of an effective security code review process.</p> ",

Even people in IT security struggle with the basic understanding of how a buffer overflow works. This workshop aims to demystify the art of exploiting vulnerabilities in binary software and equips you with the tools to pwn software on your own! We'll cover the following topics:</p> <p>1. A brief introduction to Assembly</p> <p>2. A brief overview of the Linux Stack</p> <p>3. Our Toolkit for Exploit Development</p> <p>4. Controlling the Instruction Pointer\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. Classic BOF (no strings attached)\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0b.

We do not present this so you can go out and now own the world, but to\u00a0understand how more sophisticated threat agents think and go about their development to enable and\u00a0sustain exploitation/access. We will discuss means by which the operational risk to the attacker can be\u00a0mitigated by building features and resiliency into the exploit code that is typically not seen in freely-available exploit code. Moreover, we will also cover other forms of operational risk of that can expose\u00a0the attacker to compromise themselves and how they are able to handle this risk. These features and\u00a0risks will be discussed in the context of exploit tools and software backdoors analyzed from known compromises and campaigns.</p> ",

To answer these questions, we will use machine learning (ML) to predict passengers\u2019 survival probabilities. We will guide you through building your first ML pipeline to predict survival probabilities using the original 1912 Titanic passenger dataset (courtesy of Kaggle). We will introduce fundamental ML concepts including: feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and explainability.</p> <p>Presenters:<br/>Ali Khanafer is a Senior Data Scientist at IBM.
